* Add link to the URL rewrite rules documentation
* Update scraping rules for `ilpost.it`
* Update rewrite rules for `theverge.com`
* Add a rewrite rule to remove clickbait titles
* Make sure `PROXY_IMAGES` option is backward compatible with `PROXY_OPTION` and `PROXY_MEDIA_TYPES`
* Add new rule to remove tables
* Add support for searching well-known URLs in subdirectory
* Add CSS `word-wrap` rule to break very long entry title into multiple lines
* Add swipe as option for gesture navigation between entries. There are now 3 possible choices: `none`, `double-tap`, and `swipe`.
* Prefer typographic punctuation in English translation
* Process older entries first:
    - Feed entries are usually ordered from most to least recent.
    - Processing older entries first ensures that their creation timestamp
    is lower than that of newer entries.
    - This is useful when we order by creation, because then we get a
    consistent timeline.
* Fix Grafana dashboard
* Push Docker images to `Quay.io` (RedHat)
* Bump `golang.org/x/*`, `github.com/lib/pq`, `mvdan.cc/xurls/v2` and `github.com/prometheus/client_golang` dependencies
